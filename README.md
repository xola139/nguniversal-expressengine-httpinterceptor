# nguniversal-expressengine-httpinterceptor

This is an example repo of 2 features :
- Angular server-side rendering in Node with `@angular/cli` 1.3.0 and `@nguniversal/express-engine`
- HttpInterceptor to automate absolute URLs in Universal Express engine

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Angular server-side rendering in Node

You need to use `@angular/cli` >= 1.3.0. Direct `npm update` of CLI often causes problems, if any : delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and `npm install` again.

Compared to an empty project created with CLI, new or modified files are :

- `.angular-cli.json` (modified with a second app config)
- `src/tsconfig.server.json` (new)
- `src/main-server.ts` (new)
- `src/app/app-server.module.ts` (new)
- `src/app/app.module.ts` (modified with serverTransition)
- `server.js` (new)
- `.gitignore` (modified)
- `package.json` (modified with new scripts and new packages)

## HttpInterceptor for Universal Express engine

Angular server-side rendering via `@angular/platform-server` requires absolute URLs in HTTP requests.

To automate this, an HttpClient interceptor catches all HttpClient requests and, if we're on server-side and server provided an absolute path, automatically prepend the URL.

HttpInterceptor is in `src/app/universal.interceptor.ts`.

Absolute path is provided in `server.js` :

```js
res.render('index', {
  req,
  res,
  providers: [{
    provide: 'serverUrl',
    useValue: `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}`
  }]
});
```

Note : you need to use the new `HttpClient` from Angular 4.3. It won't work on requests done with the previous `Http` API.
